1. provider
What This Means:
provider "aws":
This tells Terraform you're using AWS as your cloud provider.

region = "ap-south-2":
Specifies the AWS region where Terraform will create resources.
In this case, it's Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) (ap-south-2).

provider "aws" {
  region  = "ap-south-2"
  profile -"default"
}


2.Ec2
resource "aws_instance" "instance1" {
  ami           ="ami-0e386fa0b67b8b12c"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
Breakdown:
* resource "aws_instance" "instance1":
   This tells Terraform to create an EC2 instance in AWS.
   "aws_instance" → the type of resource (EC2 instance).
   "instance1" → the name/label you assign within Terraform.

* ami = "ami-0e386fa0b67b8b12c":
   Specifies the AMI ID (Amazon Machine Image) to use for the instance.
   This ID determines the OS and base configuration (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).
   The AMI must be valid for the region set in the provider block.

* instance_type = "t3.micro":
   Sets the type of EC2 instance (CPU, memory, etc.).
   t3.micro is a low-cost, general-purpose instance, good for light workloads.
